THANKS FOR USING CRYPER

	The program was designed for people to be able to quickly view real time exhcnage rates on world currencies (including and especially Crypto) as well as provide a program easily manipulated to send the asset (currency)
information to another API for further use. Functionality is limited at the time of this writing (06-27-2021) but more will come as I find practical use cases, or if any community input that is practical would benefit the program!
Furthermore, a config file is included in which you can set default behaviors for the program. Any time that options/ flags are passed through the program, they will ALWAYS override the default values. All response objects are in JSON
format.

	Syntax is standard shell code style, with short-hand options as the flags. Options and syntax examples as follows:

OPTIONS:

	'-a' = [runmode = 'asset'] Will send back a response that contains ALL available assets, wether Crypto or GOV currency. Negates all other options (takes no additional arguments.) 
	
	'-x' = [runmode = 'exchange'] Will put the program runmode into 'exchange', which will allow you to pass flags for the desired assets, run with the default assets, or if no arguments are present along with 'x', return an empty JSON object.
	
	'-c' = [currency] Accepts an argument IN ALL CAPS that will be the currency (usually crypto asset here) that you are viewing the exchange rate for.

	'-m' = [match_currency] Accepts an argument IN ALL CAPS that will be the currency (usually gov currency here) that you match AGAINST for the exchange rate for '-c'

	'-h' = [help page] Will print this document

	Examples: 
		
		cryper -x -c BTC -m USD = runs 'exchange' mode, matching Bitcoin against the US. Dollar.

		cryper -x -c DOGE -m KHR = runs 'exchange' mode, matching Dogecoin against the Cambodian Riel.

		cryper -a = Returns a list of all available options.

		cryper -h = Print this document!
