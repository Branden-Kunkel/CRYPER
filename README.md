# CRYPER
  A super simple script you can use to quickly view the real time exchange rates of various crypto currencies or government currencies. This program uses 
the CoinIO API @ https://www.coinapi.io/ to attain those values. YOU MUST OBTAIN YOUR OWN API KEY from that URL.
the API sends all data in JSON format, so a small code modification should allow you to parse and send these values to another API for other any number of cool projects!
A config file is included that contains places for default values. Any flags entered (if any) while using CRYPER will override the defaults.
The program has an option for installation on UNIX systems, but not for Windows YET! 
Thanks for checking out CRYPER.
