# CRYPER
  A super simple script you can use to quickly view the real time exchange rates of various crypto currencies or government currencies. This program uses 
the CoinIO API @ https://www.coinapi.io/ to attain those values. YOU MUST OBTAIN YOUR OWN API KEY from that URL.
the API sends all data in JSON foromat, so a small code modification should allow you to parse and send these values to another API for other cool projects!
A config file is included that contains default values. any flags entered (if any) while using CRYPER will override the defaults.
Thanks for checking out my silly program!
